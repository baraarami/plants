            <h3>Neptune</h3>
        <p>
            Neptune is the third largest planet in the solar system
            it is located in the eighth order in terms of its distance from the sun, 
            as it has been considered the farthest planet from the sun since scientists reclassified Pluto as a dwarf planet in 2006 AD,
            and it is also ranked fourth in terms of its size, 
            and its mass It is about 17 times the mass of planet Earth, 
            so it is considered more massive than Urans,
            whose mass is about 14 times the mass of planet Earth, 
            and it is worth noting that Neptune cannot be seen with the naked eye;
            This is due to its distance from the planet Earth,
            as it appears through the telescope as a very small pale blue-green disk.
            The reason behind its blue color is due to the absorption of red light by methane from its atmosphere, 
            and some of its physical properties are as follows :
            <ol>
                <li>The mass of Neptune: 1.0241 × 1022 kg. </li>
                <li>Size of Neptune: 62,525,703,987,421 km3. Density of Neptune: 1.638 g / cm3.</li>
                <li>Surface area of ​​Neptune: 7,618,272,763 km2.</li>
            </ol>

                  <h3>Uranus</h3>
                which can be seen with the naked eye, is one of the planets of the solar system,
                and it is ranked seventh among these planets in terms of distance from the sun, 
                as it is about 2.9 billion km from the sun, and it is ranked fourth in terms of mass compared to With the rest of the planets of the group, 
                with a mass of 86.813 * 2410 kg, Uranus is distinguished by its huge size, 
                which is four times the size of the Earth, and due to the distance of this planet from the sun, 
                it takes the equivalent of 84 Earth years to complete one revolution around it, 
                while it takes 17 hours to complete a cycle One of its rotation around itself,
                and this dimension is also the reason that the intensity of the solar light on the surface of Uranus is equivalent to approximately 1/400 of what it is on the surface of the Earth, 
                as a result of the planet's approaching the sun about 20 times compared to the distance of Uranus from it
